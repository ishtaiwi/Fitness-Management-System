## System Architecture

The system is designed with a **modular layered architecture**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance:

- **Core Features Layer**: Implements user, program, and subscription management.  
- **Data Layer**: Uses JSON files for lightweight persistence.  
- **Report Layer**: Generates attendance, revenue, and progress reports.  
- **Testing Layer**: Validates outputs and stores testing data.

# üóÇ Database (JSON Data Model)

The system uses **JSON files** to simulate lightweight database storage:

| File Name           | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **accounts.json**    | Stores user accounts (Admin, Instructor, Client) |
| **Programs.json**    | Fitness program details |
| **Enrolls.json**     | Tracks client enrollments |
| **messages.json**    | Stores private and forum messages |
| **Notifications.json** | Notifications for users |
| **schedules.json**   | Program and session schedules |
| **Users.json**       | Client profiles and personal details |
| **forums.json**      | Community discussions |
| **Reviews.json**     | Program reviews and ratings |
